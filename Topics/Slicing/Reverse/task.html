<div class="step-text">
<p>In this task, we have a list <code class="java">numbers = [2, 4, 6, ...]</code> and a line that is supposed to choose elements with <strong>indices</strong> <strong>from 4 to 16 inclusively in reverse order</strong>, but a mistake has been made. Find and fix it.</p>
<p></p><div class="alert alert-primary">With a negative step, your start index should be greater than the stop index. Choose the stop index carefully. Due to reverse order, you might want to decrease it by one in order to include the last element in your slice.</div><br><br><font color="gray">Memory limit: 256 MB</font><br><font color="gray">Time limit: 15 seconds</font><br><br>
