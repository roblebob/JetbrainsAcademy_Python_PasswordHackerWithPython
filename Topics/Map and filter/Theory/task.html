<p><strong><a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/8122" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, functional programming is a programming paradigm that treats functions as first-class citizens. | In this paradigm, programs are constructed by composing and applying functions. Two key properties of functional programming are using pure functions and immutable data types, and avoiding side effects. A pure function, like a mathematical function, takes an input and returns a value without any intermediate manipulation. For example, the sine function simply returns a value; you give it a value of x, and it returns the sine of that value. If you give it the same value, you will always get the same answer. Python is not a purely functional language, but it does implement some functional programming functionality, such as lambda functions. In the context of functional programming in Python, you can use higher-order functions to apply a function to a collection of data, such as a list, without altering the original data.">Functional programming</a></strong> is a programming paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/8122" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, a mathematical function is a type of function that adheres to the principles of mathematical functions in the realm of programming. | It takes an input, performs a specific calculation without any intermediate manipulations, and returns a resulting value. An example of a mathematical function is the sine function, where you provide it with a value of x, and it returns the sine of that value. Regardless of how many times you input the same value, the function will always return the same result. Python, although not a purely functional language, supports functional programming through features like lambda functions and higher-order functions.">mathematical functions</a>. Even though Python isn't a purely functional language, it implements some functional programming functionality, for example, <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/8122" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, a lambda function is an anonymous function that is defined using the `lambda` keyword, and it can take any number of arguments, but can only contain a single expression. | Lambda functions are useful for one-time use or when combined with other functions. They are called anonymous because they are defined without a name, and their main purpose is to make coding simpler and more efficient for small, simple functions that are used only once or a few times in a program.">lambda functions</a> that you are already familiar with. In this topic, you will learn about other useful functional programming tools: <code class="language-python">map()</code> and <code class="language-python">filter()</code>.</p>
<h5 id="map" style="text-align: center;">map( )</h5>
<p>Suppose you have a list containing some numbers:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">numbers = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]</code></pre>
<p>Imagine you now want to obtain a new list that contains the numbers from the list above multiplied by 2. </p>
<p>You can of course always pass the numbers one by one and collect the output in a for loop:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">doubled_numbers = [2*n for n in numbers]

print(doubled_numbers)
# The output is [0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18]</code></pre>
<p>However, there exists another way to do so with the help of the built-in <code class="language-python">map()</code> function. Let's take a look at its syntax:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">map(function, iterable)</code></pre>
<p><code class="language-python">map()</code> takes a function object and a list (or any other iterable, e.g., an array or a dictionary). The function is then applied to each element of that list, and<strong> </strong>an<strong> iterator </strong>is returned. You can explicitly convert it to a list using the <code class="language-python">list()</code> function to see the result.</p>
<p>So the code from the example above can be re-written as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def doubler(x):
    return 2*x

doubled_numbers = map(doubler, numbers)

print(list(doubled_numbers))
# Outputs [0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18]</code></pre>
<p>Note that we can always combine <code class="language-python">map()</code><strong> </strong>with lambda functions:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">doubled_numbers = map(lambda x: 2*x, numbers)

print(list(doubled_numbers))
# Outputs [0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18]</code></pre>
<p><code class="language-python">map()</code><strong> </strong>comes in handy when a function you want to apply several times takes multiple arguments. In that case, you can simply pass more than one list to <code class="language-python">map()</code>. The values for each argument will be then taken from the corresponding list.</p>
<p>The code below, for example, computes the sum of three lists:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">x_list = [1, 2, 3] 
y_list = [4, 5, 6]
z_list = [7, 8, 9] 

s = list(map(lambda x, y, z: x + y + z, x_list, y_list, z_list))

print(s)
# The output is [12, 15, 18]</code></pre>

<h5 id="filter" style="text-align: center;">filter( )</h5>
<p>Let's continue working with our list of numbers from 0 to 9:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">numbers = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]</code></pre>
<p>Imagine now that you want to obtain yet another list which contains only the odd numbers from the list above.</p>
<p>To that end, the built-in <code class="language-python">filter()</code> function comes in handy.</p>
<p><code class="language-python">filter()</code> takes a Boolean function, i.e., a function that returns True or False, along with a list, and constructs a new iterator from the elements of the list for which the function returns True. This iterator can be then converted to a list. The syntax is as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">filter(boolean_function, iterable)</code></pre>
<p>Thus, we can collect all the odd numbers from our list in the following way:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">odd_numbers = filter(lambda x: x % 2, numbers)

print(list(odd_numbers))
# The output is [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]</code></pre>
<p>As you might have already noticed, you can do the same thing using a <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/8122" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, a list comprehension is a concise and efficient way to create a new list from an iterable object. | It is specified by square brackets containing a for loop over the iterable object. For example, `[x for x in some_iterable]` is equivalent to the traditional for loop `for x in some_iterable: append(x)`. List comprehensions can also include an if statement to add a condition for inclusion in the new list, such as `[x for x in some_iterable if x &gt; 5]`.">list comprehension</a>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">odd_numbers = [n for n in numbers if n % 2]

print(odd_numbers)
# Also outputs [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]</code></pre>
<p> </p>
<h5 id="map-and-filter-or-list-comprehension-what-should-i-choose" style="text-align: center;">map( ) and filter( ) or list comprehension: what should I choose?</h5>
<p>As you have probably noticed while reading this material, <code class="language-python">map()</code> and <code class="language-python">filter()</code> can always be replaced by list comprehensions. So, what should be preferred? </p>
<p>Even though Python implements the functional programming functionality such as  <code class="language-python">map()</code> and <code class="language-python">filter()</code>, it isn't a functional programming language. Therefore, many developers argue that more <em>'pythonic'</em> ways should be preferred where possible. Also, some programmers find list comprehensions more readable and easy to understand.</p>
<p>At the same time, under some conditions, <code class="language-python">map()</code> and <code class="language-python">filter()</code> can be faster than list comprehensions, so it's definitely worth keeping them in mind.</p>
